                    <p>It seems there are as many techniques for assembling a color palette as there are colors, and as a designer it can be daunting to approach with a blank slate. Some designers use prescriptive methods taught in color theory classes, others go at it randomly by looking around and just finding colors that feel right. Neither of these methods is wrong, neither is right.</p>
                    <p>But there’s a color picking technique that harkens back to the very nature of color and light, and many designers don’t seem to be utilizing it.</p>

                    <p>In nature colors are far more nuanced than our rainbow color wheels. A green leaf in the shade isn’t simply a darker looking green leaf. Our eyes perceive darker shades as cooler, containing more blue, and lighter tints as warmer, contain more orange. This translates to what we feel as a lifelike, true-toned image that we often see professional cinematographers use. But we rarely use this in the brand, print, or digital design spheres.</p>
                    <p>This is because when choosing to make colors darker or lighter, it’s faster (cheaper) to simply move the brightness slider left or right. Add more black for dark, add more white for bright.</p>
